# Lab 1/ ROS Introduction

In this first repository you will find everything related to the first robotics laboratory focused on the handling of ROS through different terminals.

## Matlab
As this first part of the lab we will use the Matlab software and connect it to ROS, for that as a first step we will use:

- With Linux operating launched 2 terminals. In the first terminal typed the next command to started the master node:
 ```bash
  roscore 
```

- In the second terminal typed 
 ```bash
  rosrun turtlesim turtlesim node.
```

- A script was created with the following code:

``` Matlab
%%
rosinit; %Conexión con nodo maestro
%%
velPub = rospublisher(’/turtle1/cmd_vel’,’geometry_msgs/Twist’); %Creación publicador
velMsg = rosmessage(velPub); %Creación de mensaje
%%
velMsg.Linear.X = 1; %Valor del mensaje
send(velPub,velMsg); %Envio
pause(1)
```
The codes were run and we obtained the following result:

- We create a Matlab script to subscribe to the pose topic, using the following code:

``` Matlab
%%
poseSub=rossubscriber('/turtle1/pose','turtlesim/Pose');
poseSub.LatestMessage
```
where we use the *rossubscriber* command, to subscribe to the desired topic and the LatestMessage function that shows us the properties that the topic has.

A Matlab script was created to send all the values associated with the topic pose of *turtle1*. We used the command *rossvcclient*, this "service client" uses a persistent connection to send requests to, and receive responses from, a ROS service server, and the command *rosmessage* that creates a ROS message object which are implemented in the following code section:

``` Matlab
rosSrv = rossvcclient("/turtle1/teleport_absolute");
rosMsgPose = rosmessage(rosSrv);

rosMsgPose.X= 2;
rosMsgPose.Y= 8;
call(rosSrv, rosMsgPose)

```
we can see the result of executing the code in the following image:

Finally, we use the *rosshutdown* command to terminate the connection node between ROS and matlab, which we implement in the code as follows:


``` Matlab
%% Stop MATLAB node
rosshutdown;

```
## Python
Then Python is used to run scripts, the first script is called *myKeyControl.py*; in this way it is important to achieve the next objectives:

- Move forward with key W and move backwards with the key S
- Turn around the turtle simulation with the key A clockwise and key D counterclockwise.
- Send the turtle back in the initial position and orientation with the key R.
- Finally the turtle has to make a 180 flip with the key ESPACIO.

In order to program those objectives is needed to import the following libraries.
Then some code is used from the script *turtlevel.py*. This code was used just to run 
the correct commands to set position and orientation with the given keys.
```python
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener, KeyCode
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist 
from turtlesim.srv import TeleportAbsolute, TeleportRelative
import termios, sys, os
import numpy as np
from std_srvs.srv import Empty
def pubVel(vel_x, ang_z, t):
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
    rospy.init_node('velPub', anonymous=False)
    vel = Twist()
    vel.linear.x = vel_x
    vel.angular.z = ang_z
    endTime = rospy.Time.now() + rospy.Duration(t)
    while rospy.Time.now() < endTime:
        pub.publish(vel)
```
Ok, this is not a brand new, so the next code shows how the keyboard and the specific keys are 
Identified and then these commands are related with the service TeleportRelative, in this way 
The k is linked to this service and the turtle is going to move fluently depending on the given 

```python
def on_press(key):
    if key == KeyCode.from_char('w'):
        pubVel(1,0,2.2)

    if key == KeyCode.from_char('s'):
        pubVel(-1,0,2.2)

    if key == KeyCode.from_char('d'):
        pubVel(0,-1/2,2.2)

    if key == KeyCode.from_char('a'):
        pubVel(0,1/2,2.1)

    if key == Key.space:
        try:
            rospy.wait_for_service('/turtle1/teleport_relative')
            rotateTurtle = rospy.ServiceProxy('/turtle1/teleport_relative', TeleportRelative)
            moveRsp = rotateTurtle(0, np.pi)

            rospy.loginfo('Turtle rotated')
        except rospy.ServiceException as e:
            rospy.logwarn("Service teleport_relative call failed")

    if key == KeyCode.from_char('r'):
        try:
            rospy.wait_for_service('/turtle1/teleport_absolute')
            resetTurtle = rospy.ServiceProxy('/turtle1/teleport_absolute', TeleportAbsolute)
            resetRsp = resetTurtle(6,6, np.pi)

            rospy.wait_for_service('/clear')
            clearTraje = rospy.ServiceProxy('/clear', Empty)
            resetRsp = clearTraje()

            rospy.loginfo('Turtle reset')
        except rospy.ServiceException as e:
            rospy.logwarn("Service teleport_absolute call failed")

def on_release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        return False
```

Finally it is important to relate this new file into the launch file
and also into the part *catkin install python*  file*CMakeLists.txt*. After that
the program is ready to be used.
